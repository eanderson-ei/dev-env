    "This option takes advantage of the cleaning already done to the raw inputs and renames based on a dictionary. The dictionary is constructed for now by comparing the headers in the RAW_CODED tab to the level one headers in the RAW_INPUTS tab, and can be updated to run based on the CODEBOOK tab once complete. This approach requires that all meaningful codes be mapped to level one survey questions. The advantage to this approach is that it does not require the RAW_CODED sheet once the CODEBOOK is complete."
